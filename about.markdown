# About

I am an M.S. candidate in the Department of Future Convergence Technology at Soonchunhyang University (SCHU), Republic of Korea.  
My research focuses on how artificial intelligence can create tangible societal value in the domains of energy, mobility, and safety.

Since my undergraduate years, I have been actively engaged in lab-based research on topics such as:

- Smart grid optimization leveraging solar photovoltaic generation  
- Front-vehicle trajectory prediction for anticipatory autonomous driving  
- AI-based traffic accident ruling prediction using legal and contextual data  

These efforts have led to **three first-author SCI(E) publications** — one during my undergraduate studies and two additional papers in the first semester of my M.S. program.

Currently, in my second semester as a Master’s student, I am participating in national research projects, including an **NRF-funded CRC program**, where I aim to connect academic research with practical solutions for real-world urban and transportation challenges.  
Ultimately, I aspire to become a researcher who helps build **safer, smarter cities** where AI is a reliable foundation for future mobility and infrastructure.
