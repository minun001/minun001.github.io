## About

I am an M.S. candidate in the Department of Future Convergence Technology at Soonchunhyang University (SCHU).  
My work focuses on how artificial intelligence can create tangible societal value in the domains of energy, mobility, and safety.

Since my undergraduate years, I have been actively engaged in lab-based research on topics such as:

- Smart grid optimization leveraging solar photovoltaic generation  
- Front-vehicle trajectory prediction for anticipatory autonomous driving  
- AI-based traffic accident ruling prediction using legal and contextual data  

These efforts have led to **three first-author SCI(E) publications** — one during my undergraduate studies and two additional papers in the first semester of my M.S. program.

Currently, in my second semester as a Master’s student, I am participating in national research projects, including an **NRF-funded CRC program**, where I aim to connect academic research with practical solutions for real-world urban and transportation challenges.  
Ultimately, I aspire to become a researcher who helps build **safer, smarter cities** where AI is a reliable foundation for future mobility and infrastructure.

## Research Areas

I am broadly interested in how modern AI — including foundation models and generative models — can be grounded in real-world systems for energy and mobility.

- **Foundation Models & VLA**  
  Applying large-scale foundation models and vision–language–action (VLA) systems to embodied decision-making and complex multi-modal scenarios.

- **Autonomous Driving & Anticipatory Planning**  
  Front-vehicle maneuver and trajectory prediction (e.g., TGCA-based models) to support proactive, trustworthy autonomous driving beyond rule-based control.

- **Generative AI for Mobility & Safety**  
  Scenario generation, risk analysis, and behavior modeling for traffic and urban mobility using generative models.

- **Time Series Forecasting for Energy & Mobility**  
  Data-driven forecasting for smart grid operation, energy demand, and mobility systems.

- **AI-based Speaker Diarization & Interaction Analysis**  
  Child–parent CRC conversational data, speaker diarization, and interaction understanding to support educational and clinical insights.

- Temporal Graph Cross Attention (TGCA)-based framework for maneuver intent inference  
- Goal: enable anticipatory driving beyond threshold-based reactive control

### AI-based Speaker Diarization for CRC Data
- Speaker diarization and classification for child–parent conversational datasets  
- Combination of language models, acoustic embeddings, and diarization pipelines  
- Goal: support reliable analysis of educational and clinical interaction data

### Smart Grid & Energy AI
- Solar PV-based smart grid optimization and energy management  
- Focus on robust, data-driven decision-making for future energy and city-scale systems

## Looking Ahead

Across all of my work, I am interested in:

- Turning **advanced AI models** into **deployable systems** in mobility and energy  
- Ensuring that AI not only improves metrics in controlled benchmarks,  
  but also **makes cities safer, more efficient, and more human-centered** in practice.
