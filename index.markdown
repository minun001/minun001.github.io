# About me

I am an M.S. candidate in the Department of Future Convergence Technology at Soonchunhyang University (SCHU).  
My research focuses on how artificial intelligence can create tangible societal value in the domains of energy, mobility, and safety.

Since my undergraduate years, I have been actively involved in lab research on topics such as smart grid optimization using solar power, front-vehicle trajectory prediction for autonomous driving, and AI-based traffic accident ruling prediction. These efforts have led to three first-author SCI(E) publications—one during my undergraduate studies and two additional papers in the first semester of my M.S. program.

Currently, in my second semester as a Master’s student, I am participating in national research projects, including the NRF-funded CRC program. Through this work, I aim to bridge academic research with practical solutions for real-world urban and transportation challenges. My long-term goal is to contribute to building safer, smarter cities where AI serves as a reliable foundation for future mobility and infrastructure.

**Recent research topics include:**

- Front-side vehicle trajectory prediction with Temporal Graph Cross Attention (TGCA)
- AI-based speaker diarization for child–parent CRC datasets
- Smart grid and energy management using photovoltaic generation
