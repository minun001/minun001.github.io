I am passionate about exploring how artificial intelligence can generate real societal impact in the fields of energy, mobility, and safety. Since my undergraduate years, I have conducted research on topics such as smart grid optimization through solar power, front-vehicle trajectory prediction for autonomous driving, and AI-based traffic accident ruling prediction. These efforts have led to three first-author SCI(E) publications—one during my undergraduate studies and two more in the first semester of my Master’s program.

Currently, in my second semester as a Master’s student, I am actively involved in national research projects, including the NRF-funded CRC program, where I aim to bridge academic research with practical solutions for urban and transportation challenges. Through these experiences, I strive not only to advance academic knowledge but also to contribute to building safer, smarter cities powered by AI.
